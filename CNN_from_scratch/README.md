# Implementing CNN from scratch:
The following [iPython notebook file](https://github.com/osamanadeem9/deep-learning-projects/blob/master/CNN_from_scratch/CNN_from_scratch.ipynb) contains Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) code, created simply using python and numpy. The model is then tested over 100 images of MNIST, and compared with an equivalent keras model. The results obtained using both are models are almost the same.
